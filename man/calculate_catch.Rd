\title{Calculate Catch Weights Using Length-Weight Relationships}
\usage{
calculate_catch(catch_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{catch_df}{A tibble containing catch data with columns:
\itemize{
\item submission_id: Unique identifier for the submission
\item catch_taxon: Species or group name
\item length_class: Length class in centimeters
\item counts: Number of individuals
}}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the original catch data plus:
\itemize{
\item catch_gr: Estimated catch weight in grams
}
}
\description{
This function calculates catch weights using length-weight relationships from FishBase.
It processes catch data by mapping common names to scientific names, retrieving
length-weight coefficients, and applying the length-weight equation to estimate catches.
}
\details{
The function performs several steps:
\enumerate{
\item Groups related species categories (e.g., combining sardines and pilchards)
\item Maps common names to scientific names using FishBase
\item Retrieves length-weight relationships for species in the area (C_Code = 508)
\item Calculates median length-weight coefficients for each species group
\item Estimates catch weights using the length-weight equation: W = a * L^b
}
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Length-weight relationships are filtered for area code 508
\item Median values of length-weight coefficients are used when multiple relationships exist
\item Only relationships with no quality issues (EsQ is NA) are used
}
