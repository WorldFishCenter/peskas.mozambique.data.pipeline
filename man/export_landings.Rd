\description{
Exports validated landings data to a MongoDB collection. This function filters and
transforms preprocessed data, calculates total catch weights, and exports selected
fields to a validated collection.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Pulls preprocessed data from MongoDB
\item Calculates total catch weights per submission
\item Filters for valid survey activities (survey_activity == 1)
\item Selects relevant fields for export
\item Uploads the filtered data to the validated collection
}
}
\note{
Only submissions with survey_activity == 1 are included in the export.
Catch weights are summed per submission, with NA values removed.
}
