\title{Preprocess Lurio Landings Data}
\usage{
preprocess_landings_lurio(log_threshold = logger::DEBUG)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_threshold}{Logging threshold level (default: logger::DEBUG)}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. Function processes data and uploads to Google Cloud Storage.
}
\description{
This function preprocesses raw Lurio survey data from Google Cloud Storage.
It performs data cleaning, transformation, catch weight calculations using
length-weight relationships, and uploads processed data back to GCS.
}
\details{
The function performs the following main operations:
\enumerate{
\item Downloads ASFIS species data and Airtable form assets from GCS
\item Downloads raw survey data from GCS as Parquet file
\item Extracts and processes general trip information (dates, location, GPS)
\item Extracts and processes trip details (vessel, gear, fishers, duration)
\item Processes catch data using \code{process_species_group()} to reshape from wide to long format
\item Calculates catch weights via \code{calculate_catch_lurio()} using length-weight coefficients
\item Processes market information (catch use and price)
\item Joins all datasets and filters for active surveys
\item Maps survey codes to standardized names using Airtable assets
\item Uploads preprocessed data as versioned Parquet file to GCS
}
