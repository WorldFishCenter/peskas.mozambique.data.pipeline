\title{Expand Length Frequency Data for a Single Species Row}
\usage{
expand_length_frequency(species_row)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_row}{A single-row data frame containing one species record}
}
\value{
A data frame with one or more rows:
\itemize{
\item If length frequency data exists: multiple rows (one per length bin)
\item If no length frequency data: single row with NA for length fields
}
}
\description{
Takes a single species row and expands it into multiple rows if length frequency
data is present. Preserves all metadata (counting_method, species, etc.) throughout.
}
\details{
This function processes length frequency data in a row-by-row manner, which is
simpler and more robust than extracting all length data first and then joining.

The function:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies length group columns in the row
\item If found: pivots them to create multiple rows (one per length bin)
\item If not found: returns the row as-is with NA length fields
\item Always preserves all metadata columns
}
}
