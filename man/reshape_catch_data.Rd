\title{Reshape Catch Data with Length Groupings}
\usage{
reshape_catch_data(df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing catch data with species groups and length information.
Expected to have columns following the pattern:
\itemize{
\item species_group.X columns (where X is a position number)
\item Multiple species fields within each group (species_TL, species_RF, species_SH, etc.)
\item Optional length group columns (species_group/no_fish_by_length_group_100/)
}}
}
\value{
A data frame in long format with each row representing a species catch record.
The output includes columns:
- submission_id: Unique survey submission identifier
- n_catch: Catch record number within submission (1-based)
- counting_method: Method used to count/measure catch
- species: FAO 3-alpha species code (normalized from multiple species_* fields)
- n_buckets, weight_bucket, catch_weight: Bucket-based measurements
- length_range: Length category (e.g., "5_10", "over100")
- length_over: Specific length for fish over 100cm
- count: Number of individuals in that length range
}
\description{
This function takes KoBoToolbox survey data with species catch information and reshapes
it into long format while properly handling nested length group information. It supports
survey forms where fish over 100cm are stored in separate repeated group structures.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Reshapes species groups from wide to long using \code{reshape_species_groups()}
\item Normalizes multiple species fields (species_TL for teleosts, species_RF for rays/fish,
species_SH for sharks, species_FSH for finfish, species_CRB for crabs, species_CE for
cephalopods, species_LO for lobster, species_CR for crustacea, species_MA for marine animals,
species_OY for oysters, species_FI for fish, species_FFI for flatfish, species_RA for rays,
species_SHK for sharks, species_MZZ for miscellaneous) into a single 'species' column
\item Processes separate length group data for fish over 100cm when available
\item Combines length data with species metadata
\item Handles submissions with and without length data appropriately
}

For fish over 100cm, the function extracts both the specific length measurement
and the count, properly associating them with the corresponding species group.
